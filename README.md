# Spotilities

The goal of this app is to provide utilities and extra info that aren't included in Spotify's main app.

Spotilities is statically rendered. It doesn't require a backend to operate.

## Privacy

I do not collect any personal information or any sort of access token whatsover, it's all on your browser and only your browser :).

I added a Google Analytics plugin to see how users interact with the website, which pages you visit etc, what features you're using etc. The plugin doesn't collect any personal information either. I also opted out from sharing the information I collect with Google (Which is kind of a moot point given that the data is already stored on Google's servers).
